I really like the simplicity of this pen. It allows you to learn the basics in no time.

If you are interested in exploring flutter and dart without installing anything. Try this codepen.

You will learn how to create,

- a basic flutter UI with local data
- it touches a bit of transition animation between pages

The beauty of flutter is, you can compile and use it as web application. You can reuse as much as possible.

For most basic mobile apps that doesn't use any mobile specific API, compiled web UI from flutter work without any custom code.
