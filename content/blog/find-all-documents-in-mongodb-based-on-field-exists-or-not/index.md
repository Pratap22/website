MongoDB find syntax is pretty simple. Lets have a collection named `users` and find all the documents in the collection,

```js
// Query
db.users.find({});

// Result
[
  {
    email: 'one@email.com',
    name: 'one',
  },
  {
    firstName: 'two',
  },
  {
    email: 'three@email.com',
    firstName: 'three',
  },
];
```

If we need to filter by some field then,

```js
// Query
db.users.find({ email: 'one@email.com' });

// Result
[
  {
    email: 'one@email.com',
    name: 'one',
  },
];
```

What if we need to filter all the documents based on specific field. For example,

- list all the document which don't have `email` field
- list all documents which have `firstName` field

#### Filter document which don't have email field

It can be easily achieved using `$exists` operator on the field.

```js
// Query
db.users.find({ email: { $exists: false } });

// Result
[
  {
    firstName: 'two',
  },
];
```

#### Filter document which have firstName field

```js
// Query
db.users.find({ firstName: { $exists: true } });

// Result
[
  {
    firstName: 'two',
  },
  {
    email: 'three@email.com',
    firstName: 'three',
  },
];
```

MongoDB is very powerful and it provides a lot of methods to query what you exactly want. Hope you find this tutorial helpful ðŸ¤—
